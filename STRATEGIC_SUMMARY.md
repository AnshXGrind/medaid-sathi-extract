## 💬 Common Questions

### Q: Should I build mobile app now?
**A**: No. Focus on web MVP first. Once you have 1000+ users and feedback, then consider React Native app. Web works on mobile browsers anyway.

### Q: How do I find first users?
**A**: Start with your network. Friends, family, local doctor you know. Offer free lifetime access. Once you have 10-20 happy users, ask for referrals.

### Q: What if government approval takes long?
**A**: Don't wait! Start with private clinics. Government is a bonus, not a requirement. Practo, 1mg didn't wait for government approval.

### Q: Do I need ISO 27001 now?
**A**: No. Focus on building product first. Get ISO 27001 when you're pitching to large hospitals or government (Month 6-12).

### Q: Should I raise funding before users?
**A**: Ideally no. With 1000 users + revenue + government meeting, you'll get 3-5x better valuation. Bootstrap as long as you can.

### Q: How do I compete with Practo/1mg?
**A**: You don't compete directly. They're urban-focused. You're rural-first + government-integrated. Different market, different strategy.
